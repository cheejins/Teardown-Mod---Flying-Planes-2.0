Check out this video on how to increase the render distance of Teardown. It makes a huge difference for this mod and lets you see the entirety of any map.




[h1] About [/h1]
[list]
[*] This mod aims to be a mix of a flight simulator like DCS and an arcade flight game like Ace Combat.
[*] This mod is still in development.

[h1] Flight Modes [/h1]
[list]
[table]
    [tr]
        [td] Simple [/td]
        [td] For those who enjoy easy flying without having to worry about stalling. The point and fly control style is similar to War Thunder. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td] Simulation [/td]
        [td] Allows you to take full control of the plane's pitch, roll and yaw and calculates realistic aerodynamic forces like lift and drag. Although a little trickier to fly, I find this flight mode far more fun than the simple one.[/td]

[h1] How To Fly [/h1]
[list]
[table]
    [tr]
        [td] Taking off [/td]
        [td] Set the throttle to 100% and gain speed. Tilt the nose slightly up and let the plane climb. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td] Cruising [/td]
        [td] Set the thrust around 50% and avoid sharp turns. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td] Small map mode [/td]
        [td] Makes the plane more agile so that it can be easily controlled on smaller maps (simple flight mode only). [/td]

[h1] Controls[/h1]
[list]
[*] Press "O" while in a plane to toggle the options screen, then press "Show Controls".
[/list]


[h1] Ideas for Future Updates [/h1]
[list]
[*] AI planes (friendlies and enemies).
[*] AI navy and ground forces.
[*] More weapons like rocket barrages, guided and unguided bombs and so on.
[*] Retractable landing gear.
[*] Realistic aerodynamics (broken left wing = less left wing lift, making the plane spin. Broken rudders = less yaw, damaged engine = less thrust)
[*] Different maps based on real airports and airfields.
[*] Missions scenarios like ground elimination, dogfights, etc... (requires AI)
